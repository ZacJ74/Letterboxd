Absolutely! Let’s structure a **complete README** for your project that is clean, professional, and includes route diagrams. I’ll draft it section by section and include the ASCII-style route diagrams (you can replace them with actual images if you deploy to GitHub).

I can also make a **more visual diagram for the route flow**, using arrows and blocks, that looks great in a README and shows how the dashboard, community page, and movie CRUD pages link together.

Do you want me to make that visual route flow diagram?
